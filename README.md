# Market and Inventory Program Using Python (README)
# Prepared by Jeremy Anthony for Purwadhika JCDS Program's Module 1 Final Project
After studying and learning programming fundamentals using python language with visual studio code as the code editor in Purwadhika for around 7 days, every student is assigned to make a simple market project by utilizing all the functions in python. The Project consists of 4 main functions which are create, read, update and delete.

The Topic that I chose is about shop selling goods which is mainly used to make transactions in the store. I named the store as 'Toko Serbaguna' which sells two main items: stationery and toiletries. Here is the brief explanation of my program:

1. The main interface is divided into 5 options which are: to show the list of goods available in 'Toko Serbaguna', add goods based on the two categories, change items depending on the categories, delete items, and exit the program.

2. The first interface is divided into three options, which are to show all the items in the store, show certain items based on its category, and exit to the main interface.

This is the output if we input 1 in the first interface.

This is the output if we input 2 in the first interface, in which we need to input either 'alat tulis' or 'peralatan mandi' and if we input other than that, it will force the user to input either the two of them.

This is the output if we input 3 in the first interface. It will direct the user into the main interface. This is named 'Kembali ke menu utama' and it works the same for every option inside the main option starting from option 2 to 4.

3. The second interface is divided into two options, which are to add goods depending on the categories and exit to the main interface.

This is the output if we input 1 in the second interface. First, this input will ask what item you want to add depending on the chosen category, then it will ask what is the name of the item, the stock, price and the brand. After that, it will make sure if you really want to add the item.

4. The third interface is divided into two options, which are to change a particular good depending on the categories we choose and exit to the main interface.

This is the output if we input 1 in the third interface. First, this input will ask what category item you want to change, then it will ask what item you want to change, then input the new stock, new price and the new brand.

5. The fourth interface is divided into two options, which are to delete specific items based on the category and exit button to the main interface.

This is the output if we input 1 in the fourth interface. First, it will ask the user to choose which item depending on the category to be deleted, then it will ask the index number of the item in the table. I double check the user if they input non-numbers and the index number outside the table.

6. This is the output to check all the items that has been added, updated or deleted by functioning the first main option and then input 1 to show all the items in the store.

7. This the output of the last interface (Exit) which ends the program.
